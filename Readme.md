# ChemReasoner: Think Like a Scientist - A Specialized Reasoning LLM for Chemistry

## Overview

**ChemReasoner** is a domain-specific reasoning model specifically designed to enhance scientific reasoning capabilities in the field of chemistry. Focusing on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) adsorption as a case study, ChemReasoner leverages knowledge distillation and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to deliver scientifically accurate predictions and insights. This repository contains the resources, data, and model code for ChemReasoner, developed by Xuefeng Bai, Hao-Tian Wang, Rui Yang, Xin Zhang, Zhiling Zheng, and Jian-Rong Li from the Beijing University of Technology.

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in transforming chemical research through knowledge extraction, reasoning, and data-driven discovery. However, general-purpose designs constrain their ability for deep scientific understanding in specialized fields like chemistry. ChemReasoner addresses this by utilizing knowledge distillation from robust teacher models and CoT reasoning, developed from an extensive corpus of over 8,200 research articles and 500 reviews. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through four core task categories: experimental studies, chemical mechanisms, application scenarios, and industrialization challenges. ChemReasoner outperforms existing models like GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek-R1-671B in providing predictions consistent with DFT calculations.

## Introduction

Traditional AI applications revolutionized tasks like molecular design and reaction prediction. LLMs further accelerate these advancements by excelling in knowledge extraction and complex reasoning. Despite progress through techniques like fine-tuning, LLMs still lack the ability to perform multi-step chemical reasoning and in-depth scientific analysis. ChemReasoner tackles this by integrating domain-specific knowledge and structured CoT reasoning processes, enabling more reliable and scientifically sound conclusions.
